  <li>When used with a bike plus, it integrates with Zwift to adjust resistance and create a realistic riding experience</li>

<H2>Instalation</H2>

Peloton has done their best to lock down the android tablet attached to their bikes so that the it is very difficult to install third party apps. Anthony Doud has done amazing work with his project OpenPelo, creating an app that allows users to install apps of their choice. Please look up OpenPelo on youtube to find instructions assisting you with your installation of VeloFree.

<H2>Origen</H2>
VeloFree builds upon the Grupetto Application that can be found at https://github.com/selalipop/grupetto . The code for the Peloton Sensors is a direct copy from their project and accreditation for that code should be given to their hard work. Upon discovering the Grupetto project, it was decided to build an interface that would have all the features that could be desirable
