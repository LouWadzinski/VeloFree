<H1>VeloFree: Free Your Peloton</H1>

VeloFree is an application that allows users of Peloton Bikes to view the metrics of their activities while riding, Broadcasts those metrics via BLE to external devices. Receive BLE information from external devices.
Workout information is stored in an internal database that can then be referenced for further analysis. 
Workout information can be uploaded to platforms like Strava by exporting a TCX file from VeloFree. 

VeloFree supports the use by multiple users in a household.

When used with a Peloton Bike Plus, VeloFree adjusts the resistance of the Peloton to match the grade of the route in Zwift rides. This is the only application available that does this without the use of external hardware. 

<H2>Instalation</H2>

Peloton has done their best to lock down the android tablet attached to their bikes so that the it is very difficult to install third party apps. Anthony Doud has done amazing work with his project OpenPelo, creating an app that allows users to install apps of their choice. Please look up OpenPelo on youtube to find instructions assisting you with your installation of VeloFree.

<H2>Origen</H2>
VeloFree builds upon the Grupetto Application that can be found at https://github.com/selalipop/grupetto . The code for the Peloton Sensors is a direct copy from their project and accreditation for that code should be given to their hard work. Upon discovering the Grupetto project, it was decided to build an interface that would have all the features that could be desirable
